# Honda CRV Project

The **Honda CR-V Project** is a web-based application developed using Salesforce Lightning Web Components (LWC), designed to showcase and interact with various details of the Honda CR-V model. The application is structured into two main pages:

Home Page – Provides an overview of the Honda CR-V, including high-quality image, presented with a clean and modern user interface.

Build & Price Page – Allows users to explore customization options for the CR-V. Users can select different models and color variations based on their preferences. Once the desired configuration is selected, the user can easily submit their choices through a form.

To handle form submissions, the application integrates with Salesforce using a Web-to-Lead form. This ensures that all user inputs, such as selected model and color, are directly captured in Salesforce as leads for further follow-up or marketing purposes.

The project emphasizes user-friendly navigation, responsive design, and modern styling while leveraging Salesforce capabilities for seamless data capture and management.
